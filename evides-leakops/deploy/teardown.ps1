<#
.SYNOPSIS
  Deletes the whole Evides LeakOps demo: the resource group with everything in it (Foundry, Cosmos DB, storage, apps, monitoring).

.DESCRIPTION
  The resource group only holds this demo, so deleting it is the complete, cheapest clean-up. Foundry accounts are soft-deleted by
  Azure; this script purges the Foundry resource afterwards so the name and the model quota are free again.
  Use -WhatIf to see what would be deleted.

.EXAMPLE
  ./evides-leakops/deploy/teardown.ps1 -WhatIf
  ./evides-leakops/deploy/teardown.ps1
